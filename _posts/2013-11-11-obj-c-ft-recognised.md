After the initial release in August (and a few more iterations on GitHub), the [Obj-C-FusionTables library](https://github.com/akpw/Obj-C-FusionTables) has been officially recognized by the Google Dev Team. The library is now listed at [Fusion Tables Tools and Interfaces page](https://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/tools), as a recommended solution for integrating Fusion Tables technology into iOS apps.
