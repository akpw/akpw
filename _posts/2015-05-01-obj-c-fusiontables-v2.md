It had been over an year since last release of [Obj-C-FusionTables](https://github.com/akpw/Obj-C-FusionTables), which admittedly is a long time. Lots of things had happened since then, and several people asked questions about the current state of the project. This winter break was a very good one, and it also provided enough time for the update.

A quick list of [Obj-C-FusionTables v2.0](https://github.com/akpw/Obj-C-FusionTables/releases/tag/v2.0) new features:

* Switch to Google Fusion Tables API v2.0

* Overhaul of the sample app, now an universal iOS8 app

+  More examples of using the API within the sample app

+ Updated tests

* A workaround for [the Google Drive API bug](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26761199/google-drive-api-call-to-insert-public-share-permissions-on-fusiontables-causes/27674201#27674201)

* ```FTRowImporter```, a contribution by Adam Cumiskey

* Various overall improvements / fixes
